        <p>So what is Three.js?</p> 
        <p>Three.js is the worlds most popular JavaSrcript framework for displaying 3D content on the web.</p>
        <p>In our demo we will showcase</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How to install Three.js( and how easy it is to do so! )</li>
          <li>The main components that make up a project in Three.js</li>
          <li>The use cases for Three.js in production</li>

      <h2>How to Install Three.js</h2>
      <p>The installation of Three.js is really quite simple.</p>
      <p>We started by creating a project with Vite. We are using Vite because</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Vite's hot reload allows us to instantly see the changes made to our scene</li>
        <li>Three.js uses ES modules. Vite supports ES modules natively,<br/> so imports like import * as THREE from 'three' works perfectly out the box</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h3>In simple terms:</h3>
      <p>Three.js makes the 3D world.</p>
      <p>Vite makes your development fast and smooth</p>
